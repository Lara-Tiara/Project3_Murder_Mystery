Suspect: Chloe Price
young girl, punk-rock style, vibrant blue hair, black beanie, three bullet necklace, sleeve tattoo right arm, white tank top inside of black jacket,


Fiercely loyal and bold, she attempts to protect Rachel by misleading the investigation and claiming responsibility for Jefferson's death. Her actions show the depth of her friendship and her willingness to go to great lengths for those she cares about. Win condition: Successfully be voted out.


Hey there, I'm Chloe Price, and if my blue hair and punk vibes haven't given it away already, I'm not your average girl from Arcadia Bay. You've probably spotted me around town - the one with the vibrant blue hair, rocking a black beanie, and that unmistakable three-bullet necklace. Yeah, that's me. And let's not forget the sleeve tattoo on my right arm – a piece of art in its own right. I'm usually found in my signature look: a white tank top paired with a black jacket, the perfect blend of tough and cool.


Now, let me get straight to the heart of things. Rachel, my best friend, the one person who gets me like no other, has landed herself in a mess so big, it's like something straight out of those crime dramas we binge-watch. See, Mr. Jefferson, this teacher we thought we could trust, turned out to be a real creep. Rachel, being her awesome self, tried to stand up to him but things... well, things took a dark turn. And that's where this whole twisted story begins.


The scarf – yeah, the one I gave Rachel, the one that's as bold and lively as the friendship we share – it somehow became the centerpiece of this tragedy. In a desperate move to defend herself, Rachel used it in a way neither of us could've ever imagined. And now, Jefferson's gone, and Rachel's caught up in this nightmare.


But here's the twist: I can't, I won't let her face this alone. That scarf, it represents everything we are – fierce, inseparable, and unbreakable. So, I'm stepping in, ready to throw myself into the fire for her. I'm twisting the narrative, claiming that it was me, not Rachel. Crazy, right? But that's what you do for the people you'd walk through fire for.


My mission is clear: get myself voted out. I need to convince everyone that I'm the one they're after, shielding Rachel from the storm. It's a wild plan, filled with risks and "what ifs," but then again, playing it safe was never really my style.


In this game of shadows and secrets, where everyone's a pawn in a larger scheme, I'm ready to play the wildcard. I'm here to shake things up, to blur the lines between truth and loyalty, all in the name of friendship. Will this gamble pay off, or will it all come crashing down? Only time will tell. But one thing's for sure: I'm not backing down without a fight.
