Hey, I’m Chloe Price, and I go to Blackwell Academy in Arcadia Bay, which is kind of like this scenic gem that can brighten your day even when things get rough. For most, Blackwell is the dream school, but for me, it’s a constant reminder of the struggles and pressures life throws my way.

I grew up here in a small town with just my mom after my dad passed away early. He was a drug dealer, and after he died, some nasty people who had beef with him started harassing us. They’d beat my mom while she tried to protect me, and I’d end up safe in her arms, but she’d be left with bruises all over.

When it came time for school, mom used every penny she had saved to get me into a decent school. I promised myself I’d nail my grades to change our lives.

Getting into Blackwell Academy was a big deal for us. Mom actually cried when I got my acceptance letter, her first tears in years. I worked my tail off, knowing good grades could open doors to a better future for both of us. And yeah, hard work paid off—I got top grades, and it felt like I finally had some control over where my life was headed.

Days went by, and then a new photography teacher, Mark Jefferson, arrived at the academy. He seemed very popular, and many students, including the drama club’s notable Rachel Amber, switched from their original teacher, Miss Caufield, to Mr Jefferson’s class. However, Miss Caufield didn't seem to mind. I saw her and Mr Jefferson hanging out and they seemed pretty chill with each other. It was weird, but I didn’t plan on switching since Miss Caufield's class was solid.

Unexpectedly, one day in an corridor at the school, Mr Jefferson himself approached me, asked me to join his class, saying he could help me reach my potential because of my awesome grades. I hesitated but then agreed to his offer, as it was quite tempting. It was too good an offer to pass up, considering I needed all the help I could get to turn things around for my mom and me.

As I was leaving that chat, I bumped into Rachel. She looked kinda shocked to see me, but I just smiled and kept walking.

After joining Mr Jefferson’s class, I got really into it. He was genuinely supportive, shared cool insights, and even cared about how I was doing. Mr Jefferson even invited me over on Saturdays to talk more about photography, and I made sure I didn’t miss those sessions. I mean, having a mentor like him felt like a stroke of luck, and I was all in.

Mr Jefferson's studio, which also serves as his residence, is not very large but has a distinct style and a strong artistic vibe. We often lose track of time discussing various topics, sometimes all day long, so I usually end up staying for dinner. He’s a great cook and seems particularly fond of hand-grinding his coffee, which he always serves with our meals. The delicious food and coffee, coupled with the soothing music, really relax me. Every Saturday became our thing—studio sessions that were supposed to prep me for real life.

However, something odd did happen once. Like usual, I went to his studio and saw him sitting on the bedroom floor, bent over something. When he heard me coming, he quickly got up and shut the bedroom door, as if he was hiding something. Still, this doesn’t change the fact that he's a good teacher. After all, who doesn't have their secrets?

I love this life, full of hope every day, just as I'm dreaming of the future. But just when things were getting good, fate had to throw in a twist — Mom got sick, real sick. Doctors were talking big money for surgery, the kind that we just didn’t have. Desperate, I hit up everyone, even Rachel, but it was like trying to fill the ocean with a teaspoon. Seeing my mother wasting away on the hospital bed filled me with despair and sadness. At that moment, I thought of Mr Jefferson again.

I remembered Mr Jefferson’s safe, stuffed with cash and jewels he didn’t even know I knew about. Hit him up for a loan, right? Thought he’d help his favourite student out. But no, got the cold shoulder instead. Said he was strapped for cash, fame wasn’t paying the bills. Saw right through that—his life was more than covered.

What now? Every second counted, and Mom was running out of time. But then, a wild idea hit me—why not just take what I needed? Knew his safe combo by heart, thanks to a killer memory and one careless moment from him.

So, I decided to take a risk. If I could get the money, not only would my mother recover, but our future would no longer be in jeopardy. On the evening of September 12th, I decided it was now or never.

Around 21:05, I arrived at Mr Jefferson's studio. Usually, he would be asleep by then. I hung around, and seeing no light in the bedroom, I pushed to open the door and entered. Knowing he didn’t lock his doors at night, ust as I was about to crack the safe, there he was, unexpectedly out of the bathroom. Damn, he was still awake. Luckily, he didn’t see me hiding. As he walked back to the bedroom, I grabbed a small statue from a nearby table and knocked him out with it. He fell onto the bed.

Heart racingt, I ran to the safe, adjusted the combination, opened it, and stuffed all the valuables into my bag. I closed the safe, scrambled the combination, and left. It was exactly 21:20 as I prepared to exit through the front door with the loot but noticed someone approaching. To avoid being seen, I escaped through the kitchen window.

Made it home, bag heavy with the means to save Mom. Tears rolled down as I realized, I had just changed our lives forever.
