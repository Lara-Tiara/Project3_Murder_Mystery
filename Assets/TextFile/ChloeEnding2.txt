You didn't kill anyone, but you were powerless to resist; they simply needed someone to take the blame, regardless of whether that person was the actual murderer or not. You entered the icy prison gates in tears, knowing that your severely ill mother lying in her hospital bed no longer had any hope. The vast fortune might also get buried in the sands of time. In the future, when people excavate that site and it comes to light again, they will think of it as a treasure left by their forebears, unaware that it represents the aimless struggle and resistance of a lonely soul during a time of confusion.
