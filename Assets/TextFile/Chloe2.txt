Guard: Cough, cough. On the evening of September 12th, just last night, there was a fire at Mr. Mark Jackson's studio. Thankfully, 911 was alerted in time, and the fire didn't completely destroy his studio. However, outside Mr. Jefferson's bedroom, we found a charred body. After investigating and checking the surveillance near the studio, it appears that only the three of you were seen in that area yesterday, which is why I've called you here today!


Task:
You need to keep searching the clues and carefully decide which to share.
