Guard: Just now, during the evidence search, our team found a small door under the bedroom floor that leads to a basement. Incredibly, we found Mr. Jefferson's body there! Now, can anyone tell me who this charred person is?! I'm running out of patience. Quickly find the murderer, and remember, I want the murderer responsible for both deaths found. I don't care how many people are involved; I just want results, or else I will have all three of you thrown into jail!
