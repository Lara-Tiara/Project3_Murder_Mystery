Everything looks wonderful, but it seems like something was overlooked, right? Could it be those photos that Jefferson secretly took and sold? Indeed, those photos ended up spreading everywhere, and you felt as though everyone looked at you with contempt. You took your mother and left Arcadia, but still felt unsafe, you know the wound inside your heart might never heal.
