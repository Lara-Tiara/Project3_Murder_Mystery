Had you managed to escape, you could have continued chasing your grand dream, but you know you would have been plagued by endless regret and self-blame, trapped in your own guilt. Perhaps this outcome is actually the best for you. You close your eyes, gazing at the bright moon beyond the prison bars, struggling to fall asleep.
