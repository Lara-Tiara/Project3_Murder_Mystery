You not only avenged your sister but also managed to escape unscathed. It's all over now. Standing at your sister's grave, tears fall as you slowly recount everything that has happened. Her photo on the tombstone smiles radiantly, almost as if reproaching you for taking such risks. You know she always wanted you to live safely and happily. Later, you left Blackwell and Arcadia, moving to a distant place. You want to forget all that has happened here, including your memories of your sister, and to live a good life.
