Congratulations, you got what you wished for and avoided legal repercussions. The events of that night no longer unsettle you or cause you unrest. You continue to chase your grand dream, but for some reason, you no longer possess the passion you once did. At midnight, when memories flood back, you always think of Jefferson's vile face and the harrowing cries of innocent Bill. You despise Jefferson and yourself. You know that your dream is shattered. Hatred and guilt intertwine relentlessly within you. Unexpectedly, a single misstep has forever ensnared you in that sorrowful, grief-stricken night, from which you can never escape.
