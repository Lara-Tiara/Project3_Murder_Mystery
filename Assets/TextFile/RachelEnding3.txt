In the end, you did become a murderer, but it wasn't entirely without reason since it was your actions that cost an innocent person their life. For you, bearing one guilt or two makes no difference; the outcome remains the same. You've fantasized about escaping and continuing your grand dream, but you know that you would live in endless regret and self-blame, unable to free yourself. Perhaps this is the best outcome for you. You close your eyes and gaze at the bright moon outside the prison bars, struggling to sleep.
