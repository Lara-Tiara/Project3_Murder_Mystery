I am Rachel Amber, a student at Blackwell Academy. Actually, rather than just a student, I prefer to introduce myself as a core member of the Blackwell Academy drama club. I say this because of my position in the drama club, where I tend to be humble in other respects, but when it comes to acting, I believe I have the right and ability to proudly stand out and praise myself.

Yes, I have always wanted to be a great actress since I was young, it is my dream, like the visions that appear in everyone's mind in the middle of the night. Only, I am luckier, or rather, more capable, as I have ultimately embarked on the journey of pursuing my dream.

In fact, regarding the dream of becoming an actress, it is not just talk. I am very aware that both effort and talent are indispensable, and fortunately, I possess both.

As a result, I quickly became well-known in the academy. Everyone recognizes me and knows who I am, and I enjoy everything that happens. The admiring or loving gazes from under the stage satisfy me, I was born to stand on stage and shine.

However, I am also aware that just being famous in the academy is not very useful. I need more opportunities to let more people know about me, but unfortunately, in the small town of Arcadia Bay, such opportunities are almost nonexistent.

So, talent and effort are still not enough, sometimes, a bit of luck and opportunity are also necessary. However, what I did not expect was that such an opportunity would come so soon.

A new photography teacher arrived at the academy. Initially, I didn't pay much attention because my previous photography teacher, Max, was also excellent, and I didn't think the new teacher would be better than her. But when I learned the name of the new teacher, I realized how wrong I was.

Mark Jefferson! The new photography teacher is Mark Jefferson, who is extremely famous. As someone aspiring to be a great actress, naturally, I knew his name. Mr. Jefferson has a significant influence in the field of photography and has won many honors. If he could be my photography teacher, oh my, I can hardly imagine it, this might be my chance to reach a bigger stage.

So, I switched from Max’s class to Mr. Jefferson's. It turned out that my choice was correct. Mr. Jefferson is not only knowledgeable but also often introduces us to celebrities in the photography industry, all of whom are cinematographers for famous films.

Moreover, I noticed that not only I, but many students left Max's class to attend Mr. Jefferson's lectures. Even top students like Chloe did the same, which further proves my choice was correct. Surprisingly, Max doesn’t seem bothered by it, doesn't she get angry that Mr. Jefferson took her students? This seems weird to me.

Then, something strange happened. One day, as I was passing through a corridor at the school, I was surprised to see Mr. Jefferson talking with Chloe about something. Chloe hesitated for a moment, nodded her head, and was about to leave when she noticed me. She smiled at me and then left. Since then, her relationship with Mr. Jefferson became closer, and they often discussed issues together, which made me a bit jealous. I also performed well, what exactly did they talk about in that corridor that day?

After class that day, Chloe suddenly approached me hoping I could lend her some money. I found it strange since we were not very close, why would she borrow money from me? But still I lent it to her thinking it might help me with Mr. Jefferson later on.

I always knew being smart and tactical would pay off. And sure enough, Mr. Jefferson noticed me. He wants to take artistic photos of me for his next exhibition! This could be huge—like celeb-status huge. If my photos get displayed there, it could really put me on the map.

I said yes without a second thought and circled September 12th in red on my calendar. I can’t wait for that day to come!

Man, I never saw this coming. Reality can be brutal.
At 17:00 on the evening of September 12, I showed up at Mr. Jefferson’s studio. Mr. Jefferson warmly welcomed me in, and it was then I realized that this place was not only his studio but also his flat.

Mr. Jefferson smiled and poured me a cup of coffee. I politely thanked him, but I'm not into coffee, so I didn't drink it. My head was totally in the game, ready to nail these artistic portraits.

Mr. Jefferson noticed I was a bit on edge, tried to chill me out, and asked if I had eaten anything. I was so excited before coming that I hadn't even felt hungry, but now that he mentioned it, my stomach even growled a couple of times in agreement. Embarrassing, right? But he was chill about it and went to fix us some food.

At 18:30, Mr. Jefferson brought two plates of food to the dining table and invited me to join him. We were sitting down to eat, and then he brought out a bottle of whiskey from the kitchen, pouring two glasses to celebrate our collaboration. I’m not much for whiskey either—actually, it's worse than coffee. I intended to refuse, but he was so pumped about it, so I sipped a little bit and then, while wiping my mouth, spat the whiskey onto a napkin. However, it seemed Mr. Jefferson didn't notice. We chatted for a bit, and then I suddenly felt super tired and passed out on the table.

At 19:30, I slowly woke up, only to find myself lying naked on a bed, with Mr. Jefferson holding a camera and changing angles to take photos. I screamed, covered myself with a blanket, and shout at him. He just smiled creepily and said this was his idea of an "artistic portrait." Yeah, right.

I hadn't expected this. In a panic wrapped in a blanket, I tried to escape. Mr. Jefferson chased after me and grabbed me. I yelled for help. Mr. Jefferson covered my mouth and told me to listen to him first, but at that moment, all I wanted was to escape this nightmare.

So, I bit his hand hard, and he had to let go. Then he slapped me hard, and I fell onto the sofa. Watching him wickedly approach me, fear, panic, and hatred... a mix of complex emotions flooded my heart. Just then, I spotted a fruit knife on a nearby table. In a panic, I grabbed the knife and stabbed Mr. Jefferson in his side. He looked at me in shock. "Bang", my hand couldn't stop shaking, and the knife fell to the ground. I was terrified, I quickly got dressed and ran out of there.

By 19:50, it was completely dark outside. What I didn't expect was that shortly after leaving, around 20:00,  I bumped into Ms. Max, who was oddly heading toward Mr. Jefferson’s studio. She seemed surprised and asked what I was up to. I had to lie that I was just taking a walk nearby. While speaking, she glanced at my hands, and I quickly hid them behind my back to prevent her from seeing the bloodstains. I made up a few more excuses and quickly ran away.

At 20:10, back at home, my heart was still pumping hardly. I was worried about being exposed. I cleaned off the blood and burned my stained clothes, trying to figure out what to do next.

What to do, what should I do? I kept asking myself as I smoked one cigarette after another, but I still couldn't calm down. Did Mr. Jefferson die? If he didn't and he called the cops, my acting career would be ruined. Damn it, why did I forget to clear his camera when I left? If he died, there were still so many clues at the scene, even my fingerprints on the knife. If it traced back to me, the outcome would be the same. Thinking over and over, I became more and more panicked, and finally, I decided to go back to Mr. Jefferson's studio and burn everything to the ground.

At 21:20, it was already late at night, and all was quiet. I brought the gasoline I had prepared and arrived near Mr. Jefferson's studio. The night was dim, and through the bedroom window, I could see Mr. Jefferson lying on the bed, maybe asleep. I sneaked into his studio through the front door, turned off the water supply, and snuck into the bedroom. I quietly poured gasoline over his blanket, and with a lighter, I lit it up. After a while, he screamed as the fire blazed, the voice twisted and sharp with pain, vastly different from Mr. Jefferson's usual voice. 

He tried to escape the bedroom, but I had already barricaded the door with the dining table, and his voice grew increasingly desperate. Then I heard the sound of breaking glass, he must've tried the window. To avoid any accidents, I also rushed outside the studio.

Mr. Jefferson rolled on the ground, enveloped in flames, but the gasoline on his body made it futile, and soon he stopped moving as the fire consumed him more fiercely.

At 21:50, watching the studio in flames, I knew that all evidence and clues would be turned to ashes in this fire.
